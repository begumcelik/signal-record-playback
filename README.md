# Record and Playback the Signal Output of Black Box System

This project is designed to record the signal output of Stephan von Huene's artwork called _What’s wrong with Art? (1997)_. However, the project can be thought of as a generic conservation workflow for artworks working in a similar manner. 

_This project is developed in ZKM Karlsruhe._
